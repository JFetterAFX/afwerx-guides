# Find tips and best practices from across the AFWERX community
You've heard about innovation efforts across the Air Force and wonder how to actually implement them at your base.  However, it seems like **each base is starting from scratch**.

We've established a set of **community-developed guides** to share knowledge across the [AFWERX](https://www.afwerx.af.mil/) community.

### You might be asking:
- What's the first step to set up a Spark Cell?
- How do I buy tools and equipment for my innovation lab?
- How can I use Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding, i.e. *other people's money*, to fund innovation projects?
- Can we really *contract directly* with a company who has completed a SBIR project?
- How can I have companies *pitch us* their innovative, off-the-shelf products to solve my unit's biggest challenges?

These guides provide **step-by-step instructions, best practices, and tips** created by innovators from across the AFWERX community.

These people have **paved the way** and are interested in **sharing their experience**.

Check out the various topics in the menu or get started with Spark Cell 101.

## Interested in contributing to the guides?
If you have experience or knowledge to share with the community, we're interesting in **adding you as a contributor** to the project.

The goal of the open-source [AFWERX Guides project](https://github.com/infinity-spark-jbmdl/afwerx-guides) is for members of the community to contribute and improve the guides.

The project is **beginner-friendly** and we hope many people are able to make their **first open-source contribution** through this project.

Check out Contributing to the Guides to see how.
