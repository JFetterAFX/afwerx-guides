## Logistics

1. Early PA/Protocol/Wing Leadership partnership to establish communication plan
    1. Socialize the event with Wing leadership (Spark champion) to get buy-in
    2. Request photojournalist to document event
    3. Partner with protocol on a modified DV checklist that fits your event
2. Determine facilities (On/Off Base, Auditoriums, Aircraft Static Displays, etc.)
    1. Entry Access List (EAL) for government facilities
    2. Security Forces requirements
    3. Potential use of local PTAC space
    4. Request aircraft static displays through Current Ops
    5. Request flight line photography approval from PA
3. Determine transportation requirements
    1. Coordinate with Vehicle Control Center for a bus that can accommodate all guests (WG/CC can approve busses for visitors)
    2. Borrow U-Drive for staff to utilize for unforeseen guest requirements (early departures, etc.)
4. Develop schedule/agenda (keep it simple & build in slack for changes in itinerary)
    1. Event description (the “why”)
    2. Target audience (the “who”)
    3. Itinerary (the “what”)
        1. Introductions & SBIR overview
        2. Company pitches & collisions
        3. Lunch & networking
        4. Base pain point tour

    5. List of base stakeholders attending (Sq mission statements)
    6. Task squadrons to identify their problem statements and SMEs
5. Extend invitations to partners and stakeholders

## Problem Statements & Connecting to Companies

1. Identify local base pain points and refine problem statements
    1. Critical piece to ensure you attract the right partners
    2. Develop a 1 pager on pain points and focus areas to distribute to potential partners
2. Connecting SBIR Companies/COTS solutions to problem statements
    1. Engage with AFWERX to obtain a list of SBIR Phase I companies
    2. Down-select the companies that can potentially solve local pain points
    3. Invite 2-3 companies with promising tech that don’t necessarily align with local pain points but can potentially inform future “unknown unknowns”
    4. Schedule calls with each interested company to refine customer discovery
    5. Connect company with unit on base and identify local SME to invite to event
