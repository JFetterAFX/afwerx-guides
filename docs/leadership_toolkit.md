# Squadron Leadership Toolkit

_"Success no longer goes to the country that develops a new fighting technology first, but rather to the one that better integrates it and adapts its way of fighting …Our response will be to prioritize speed of delivery, continuous adaptation, and frequent modular upgrades. **We must not accept cumbersome approval chains, wasteful applications of resources in uncompetitive space, or overly risk-averse thinking that impedes change**.”  James “Mad Dog” Mattis, 2018_

## Why should you embrace innovation?

1. Your job is to manage resources and improve your unit.
2. Innovation is key to reform & lethality; two of the three NDS 2018 lines of effort.
3. The Air Force is trying to **reinvigorate your squadron.**

## What does SPARK offer?   

1. You will fund projects through non-traditional contracts you otherwise cannot access.
2. Your Airmen will directly network with senior AF leadership.
3. Your Airmen will gain breadth of experience by working with other agencies.
4. Your Airmen will create base, MAJCOM, and possibly DoD-level impacts.
5. Your Airmen will partner with AFRL, Kessel Run, DIU and other innovation giants.

## 2019 SPARK successes:
